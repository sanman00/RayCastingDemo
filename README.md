## Ray Casting Demo ##
### About ###
This project contains a demonstration of ray-casting (although, it is probably not a proper demonstration). This is mostly used to illustrate how a "ray" can come from the player to the mouse and how the player's direction can be inferred from the angle of the ray.

### Building ###
Open the project in Netbeans (or try to import it into another IDE) and build it.
